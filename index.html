            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Ada, Countess of Lovelace and am an English mathematician 
                and writer, chiefly known for my work on Charles Babbage's proposed 
                mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
            <p>I am one of the first to recognize that machines have applications 
                beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm 
                intended to be carried out by such a machine.</p>
            <p>In my free time I like to read about scientific developments, 
                mathematics, and computational mathematics. I also like to take my 
                chances of winning big.</p>
